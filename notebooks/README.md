# Notebooks for Reproducibility

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for reproducing all the main results, figures, and tables from the paper:

- Enumeration experiments for various $(n, K, U, R)$ parameter sets
- Growth rate and asymptotic analysis
- Application demonstrations for DNA storage and flash memory
- Performance and scalability benchmarks

Each notebook is self-contained and documents its dependencies.
